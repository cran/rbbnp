Description: A novel bias-bound approach for non-parametric inference is introduced, 
    focusing on both density and conditional expectation estimation. 
    It constructs valid confidence intervals that account for the presence of 
    a non-negligible bias and thus make it possible to perform inference with 
    optimal mean squared error minimizing bandwidths.
